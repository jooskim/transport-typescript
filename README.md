# Transport - TypeScript

## Overview
### What is Transport?

Transport is a lightweight, framework-agnostic event bus that simplifies state management
in modern distributed web applications. This repository is the TypeScript implementation
of the Transport event bus which provides a reactive publish-subscribe infrastructure along with
built-in support for WebSocket over the STOMP to facilitate decoupling, modularization and universal design.

### A distributed event bus
Transport can be distributed across applications and connected up to RabbitMQ, Kafka or NATS.
It is also an API transport infrastructure & state store which enables actors using Transport to
utilize similar API interfaces across different language implementations.

### An internal freeway system, for applications.
Transport is part of VMware's UI architecture strategy. It decouples presentation logic,
from business logic via an asynchronous event bus. This bus is built on top of ReactiveX
that results in a super fast, super scalable mechanism for actors to communicate and decouple logic.
Transport can be extended from communication within UI components (for managing
Single Page Application states), to UI-to-backend or even backend-to-backend communication.

## Quick Start

```
npm install @vmw/transport --save
```

### Adding Transport to your web application

#### Option 1: ES6 module import (recommended)
This is the recommended way to import Transport as it allows build management tool
such as Webpack to treeshake unused exports of the library shaving off some bits in size.

To import and initialize Transport, simply call `BusUtil.bootBus()` as follows:

```typescript
import { BusUtil } from '@vmw/transport/util/bus.util';

// boot the event bus!
BusUtil.bootBus();

// once booted you can access the event bus instance from BusUtil.getInstance()
console.log(BusUtil.getInstance());

// you can destroy the event bus like this.
BusUtil.destroy();

// then boot the bus again with options to customize it. for example you can
// initialize the bus with the log level set to warning, the boot message
// enabled (second argument), and the dark console theme applied (third argument).
BusUtil.bootBusWithOptions(LogLevel.Warn, false, true);
```

#### Option 2: Using UMD module in Angular
Angular provides `angular.json` (for Angular 7+) and `angular-cli.json` (for Angular 4-5).

In this file, there is a section defined as scripts. This section is where you provide third party scripts to be booted and loaded by your Angular application.

You will need to add the Transport UMD file to this section. It's already been saved in your node_modules folder. Just provide an entry like the one below.

Configuring angular.json
```json
...
"scripts": [
   "node_modules/@vmw/transport/transport.umd.min.js"
]
...
```
Your application is ready to go, now you just need to boot transport

Angular provides a src/main.ts file, which is essentially your initialization script, that you can use to Initialize the Bus.
See Option 1 above for instructions on initializing the bus. 

#### Option 3: UMD module import through HTML `<script>` tag
Alternatively if you would like to use Transport in a simple setup, say an HTML
with WebComponents in it, you can import the UMD version of the library via a `script` tag.
Note that RxJS is the only prerequisite for Transport so make sure to import it first.

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/rxjs@6.6.3/bundles/rxjs.umd.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@vmw/transport@latest/transport.umd.min.js"></script>
<script>
   // boot the event bus!
   transport.TransportEventBus.boot();

   // once booted you can access the event bus instance at window.AppEventBus.
   console.log(AppEventBus);

   // destroy the event bus.
   transport.TransportEventBus.destroy();

   // boot the event bus with options.
   transport.TransportEventBus.bootWithOptions(1, false, true);

</script>
```


### Importing Transport in your code
The main interface you will need is EventBus. It provides access to the most common methods.

```
import { EventBus } from '@vmw/transport';
```

### Hello World

```typescript
export class HelloWorldComponent extends AbstractBase implements OnInit {

    constructor() {
        super('HelloWorldComponent');
        this.run();
    }

    run() {

        // define a channel to talk on.
        let myChannel = 'some-channel';

        // listen for requests on 'myChannel' and return a response.
        this.bus.respondOnce(myChannel)
            .generate(
                (request: string) => {
                    this.log.info(`Request Received: ${request}, Sending Response...`);
                    return 'world';
                }
            );

        this.log.info('Sending Request');

        // send request 'hello' on channel 'myChannel'.
        this.bus.requestOnce(myChannel, 'hello')
            .handle(
                (response: string) => {
                    this.log.info(`hello ${response}`);
                }
            );
    }
}
```
